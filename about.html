        <p>Hi, I am Sakshi Jain, living with a passion and focus towards web developement. I believe process is more gold than the 
            byproduct of it i.e. job. And neogcamp helped me in finding that inner coder in me who has once chosen computer science
            in 11th class to pursue something , don't know what in computer field. I feel the journey of one month
             with @tanaypratap sir made me code my console.log("hello world");
        </p>
